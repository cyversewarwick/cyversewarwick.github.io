This meeting is focused on researchers who are either toward the beginning of their studies or have moved onto a new subject area. We will provide a hands-on sessions that will describe the use of software tools that can interrogate RNAseq, imaging, gene expression or GWAS data. Previous CyVerse users will provide real-life examples of how the software has been successfully used. This is the **Learner Track**

In addition we will host a concurrent track for more experienced bioinformaticians who wish to learn how to use CyVerse to host their own programs. This is the **Intermediate Track**. The concurrent tracks will run in separate rooms.

These software tools have been developed as part of the [CyVerseUK grant](http://www.cyverseuk.org). We will also highlight the opportunities that exist for the sharing of big data in a meaningful manner.
This workshop is organised by GARNet with Professor Katherine Denby at the University of York.
