A presentation was held at Warwick Systems Biology Centre about what CyVerse UK is and more specifically on what we do at Warwick for this project. The presentation had two parts.

In the **first part**, we gave a detailed overview on the infrastructure we have here at Warwick in terms of both software and hardware. The slides used for this part is as shown in the following PDF.

We demonstrated our applications live on our [local Discovery Environment](https://cyverse.warwick.ac.uk/de) in the **second part** of this presentation. More specifically, we demonstrated the Expression Data Analysis Pipeline in action. An introduction of this pipeline can be read [here](https://cyversewarwick.github.io/2016/07/12/expression-pipeline.html). Additionally, a tutorial is also available [here](https://cyversewarwick.github.io/2016/12/13/expression-pipeline-tutorial.html).
